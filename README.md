### How to Install Packages

`npm i` to install all packages in this repo - (which is literally just mocha for testing, so this shouldn't take too much time)

### How to Run Code

`npm run test` to run the mocha tests
`npm run dev` to run the `copy.js` file

For the `copy.js` file, I was using console logs to manually test - I would suggest you insert what you would like to copy as an argument for the copier function, and then console log the result. I left my previous console logs within the file to serve as an example.
